### !! IMPORTANT !!

This github has been setup to track issues and log updates & fixes.

The source code will **not** be made publically available for anyone because:
- The point of the application is to have one central database where any player can register their character
regardless of the server they are playing on. 
- The code has been tailored to fit the City of Heroes game, nothing else.


Thank you.
